Dark Matter Radio is a 10-channel sound installation which draws on the current quest to find the frequency of a dark matter wave. The project is inspired by the description of the ADMX "axion haloscope", one of many Dark Matter research initiatives, as “a radio that looks for a radio station, but we don’t know its frequency. We turn the knob slowly while listening. Ideally we will hear a tone when the frequency is right.” 
The installation translates simulations of a related type of Dark Matter into sound patterns. Each speaker sits at a location in the simulation, and quantities like the Dark Matter speed and density are used to generate the sound and shape its harmonic structure. These simulations feature wavelike coherence, correlating nearby speakers and passing waves around the ring. This generates psychoacoustic effects in the listeners based on their position in relation to each speaker. In between each speaker there is a small VU metre, trembling to echo a volatile, dynamic and ever-changing frequency field, though what exactly is being measured is uncertain.
